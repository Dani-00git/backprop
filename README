Before running, modify line 11, put the file path of the train dataset in csv format inside the brackets.
The file can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/oddrationale/mnist-in-csv.

Once this is done you can run, every 100 iterations the loss function is printed on the screen and gradually decreases.
At the end a graph is printed showing the average loss as a function of the number of iterations and the percentage of correct predictions in the test phase.
It should take about a minute to run the code.
